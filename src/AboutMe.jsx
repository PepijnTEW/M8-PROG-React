          Hey! Iâ€™m Tyler, Iâ€™m 14, and Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m the smartest coder
          alive (okay, maybe just in my school for now ðŸ˜Ž). I started coding
          when I was a kid, and now Iâ€™m creating games, bots, and mods like itâ€™s
          second nature. When Iâ€™m not behind the keyboard, Iâ€™m ruling Minecraft,
          Redstone genius, PvP champ, and the guy who builds bases so good they
          should be in museums. Creative? Survival? Doesnâ€™t matter. I dominate
          both.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
